# restaurant-locator
This is a react-native application dedicated to finding restaurants near your via Yelp API. The app will automatically find your location and you will have the option of searching for any keyword you want (e.g 'pasta', 'chinese', etc.). You can also click on the restaurant to gain additional info. 

To install, simply execute yarn.

To start, execute yarn start or expo run.

You will need a Yelp Developer account to run this application. You can either contact me or get your own developer account from <https://www.yelp.com/developers>. Once you do, replace the Authorization token with your own in src/api/Yelp.js
